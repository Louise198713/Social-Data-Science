## Projects from 9th semester Social Data Science course
Each of the three first modules were concluded with a group assignment based on a self-selected data set. Module 4 consisted of a larger project where it was encouraged to collaborate with an extern party eg. a firm.

### Module 1 -  Machine Learning

Construction of a model able to classify Portougese students as either passing or failing their final examn based on former grades as well as different social variables.

### Module 4 - Final project 

The project was developed in collaboration with Dyrl√¶ger&Ko with the purpose of constructing one or more models able to classify diseases in cows. The models were, among other variables, constructed based on clinical parameters and milk yield.
